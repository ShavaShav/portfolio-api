# Background

- I have a breadth of devops skills, including Certified Kubernetes Adminstrator and setting up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
- I also have skills in project management, specifically using the agile methology. I always like to plan out a project, with the knowledge that many of the plans will change or be abandoned altogether. I believe that you need planning for a project to succeed.

- Travelled to Japan, Mexico and United States
- I've loved computers since I was a young kid, and built many websites back then for various hobbies and interests.
- In University, I fell in love with software all over agin. I committed to learning how computers, algorithms and data structures work, and learning the best practises of software engineering, and I really excelled in the program.
- I chose application development, in particular web apps, because I love building things that people use directly. I enjoy building delightful user experiences, with a solid foundation in computer science which keeps applications lean, performant with a low maintenance cost.

# Design patterns

- Design patterns
  - Event based systems
    - Notifications
  - Authentication / authorization
  - Distributed message passing (pulsar)
  - Websockets and server-sent events for real time updates
  - In graphQL, made use of patterns such as "dataloading" and field level resolving to reduce overfetching and optimize requests.
  - Object oriented design where applicable
- Scaling and reliability
  - Certified kubernetes administrator
  - Have designed several solutions with scalability in mind, as the data generation process in machine learning can be scaled up to thousands of processes on a single cluster.
- Database design
  - Strong understanding of relational databases, data integrity, data migrations, data backups/restore
- Set up CI/CD processes, including branching strategy and staging/production servers.
- Test planning
  - Developed test cases for end to end testing of system
  - Automated a section of them in a smoke test
  - Set up test plans to run before release to ensure core functionality is not broken
- Se up monitoring systems with Prometheus and Grafana. Identified key metrics important to the business, exported them in the code and showed them on dashboards, with alerting.
- Have always placed importance in solid project management. As when a project is manage poorly it is demotivating.
